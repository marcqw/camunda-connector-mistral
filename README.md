## Authentication

To use the **Mistral Connector**, obtain an API key from Mistral. To create an Mistral account and learn more about API keys, visit the [Mistral Platform](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/) documentation.

### Create a new Connector secret

Keep your **API key** safe and avoid exposing it in the BPMN `xml` file by creating a secret:

1. Follow this [guide for creating secrets](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/console/manage-clusters/manage-secrets/).
2. Name your secret (i.e `MISTRAL_API_KEY`) so you can reference it later in the Connector.

### Configure the API key

Inside **Mistral Server** section, select the **OpenAI API key** field in the **Authentication** section and set it to the secret you created (e.g. `{{secrets.MISTRAL_API_TOKEN}}`).
